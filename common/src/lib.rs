//! Shared types, constants, and currency registry for InvoFi Soroban contracts.

//! `registry` and `financing` both depend on this crate. The currency → SEP-41
//! token registry lives here so adding a third currency means one
//! `register_currency` call — never a new branch in every money-touching
